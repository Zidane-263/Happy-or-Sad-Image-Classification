# Happy or Sad Image Classification

# Objective
To create a robust image classification system using deep learning techniques that can automatically distinguish between 'happy' and 'sad' emotions in images, aiming to improve the emotional intelligence of AI systems for various applications, including mood analysis and sentiment recognition.

# Environment Setup
Download the codebase and open up a terminal in the root directory. Make sure python 3.11 is installed in the current environment. Then execute, pip install -r requirements.txt

# Dataset information
The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.
